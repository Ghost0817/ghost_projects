Did you know that without correct posture, your chances of being diagnosed with Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) which is a potentially disabling illness caused by prolonged repetitive hand movements, such as those involved in computer use, is increased?','<p>In today’s world we inevitably have to spend some time in front of the computer typing. Did you know that without correct posture, your chances of being diagnosed with Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) which is a potentially disabling illness caused by prolonged repetitive hand movements, such as those involved in computer use, is increased? Symptoms include intermittent shooting pains in the hands, wrists, forearms, and back. It is important to have a correct typing position to avoid the development of RSI or other pain related diseases. Very few of us type for less than 2-3 hours a week, but the majority of us who sit for prolonged hours in front of the computer should keep the following in mind.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Head, Back &amp; Shoulders Straight</h3>\\r\\n<p>In common language you are told to keep your head, back and shoulder straight. The upper arm should be straight and lower arm at 90 degree straight on the table. The wrists should be at same level as the keyboard keys such that the arm muscle share the typing pressure, not only your fingers. Keep your legs straight down on the floor. The keyboard should not be hit hard and the mouse should not be gripped too tightly. Keep ample space on and under the working table. The computer monitor should be at eye level at appropriate distance from you.</p>\\r\\n<h3>The Ideal Typing Posture</h3>\\r\\n<p>In the ideal typing posture both the static and the dynamic muscle loads are minimized. This posture is achieved when the keyboard is below seated elbow height and the keyboard base is gently sloped away from the user so that the key tops are accessible to the hands in a neutral posture. In this position the arms, shoulders, neck and back can relax, especially during brief rest pauses. Also, in this slightly reclined sitting position the low back rests against the lumbar support of the chair, the elbow angle is opened to promote circulation to the lower arm and hand, the abdominal angle, and the popliteal angle (behind the knees) are opened to promote blood circulation. The feet rest firmly upon the floor.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Take Regular Breaks</h3>\\r\\n<p>It is also very important to take regular breaks. It is advised to take a 5 minute break after every 30 minutes of continuous activity. Make a schedule and fix an alarm if you are already suffering from RSI to alleviate symptoms. Always sit up straight and get some exercise everyday. Be especially mindful of your weight. The chair also plays an important role here. It should be non-sliding and have five point bases. Fully adjustable with height adjustments, tilts, backrest, and arm rest is ideal. If you fear you have syndromes of RSI, visit a doctor. Do not let the pain increase so much as to disturb your sleep or force you to take a break.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Use Devices to Help</h3>\\r\\n<p>There are many devices available in the market to help you type in the correct posture such as work surface or ergonomic working tables. Monitor arms allow adjustment of the monitor which helps achieve the correct posture. A document stand will allow you keep the documents at eye level, thus reducing stress. Wrist rests help to use the keyboard and mouse correctly, reducing weight on your shoulders. A mouse support strap cuts down the distance between the keyboard and mouse drags it near you to correct your reaching posture and is attached to the keyboard and mouse is placed on this strap. With the correct posture and appropriate devices, you will be able to make use of your time and talent without the fear of any pain!</p>','2013-12-22 17:23:17','typing-posture.png','typing-posture.png',701,275,'','',''),(33,1,'What is \'Words Per Minute\'?','what-is-words-per-minute','Ask anyone how fast they type and they\\\'ll proudly tell you their words per minute (WPM), but ask even your speediest friends how WPM is calculated and you\\\'ll likely get a lot of \\\"um\\\", \\\"hmm\\\", \\\"uhh...\\\" responses.

Today, we\\\'re going to fix that!</p>\\r\\n<h2>The Basics of WPM</h2>\\r\\n<p>Words Per Minute is the number of characters -- including spaces and punctuation -- typed in one minute, divided by five. \\\"I can\\\" counts as one word, while \\\"popularize\\\" and \\\"let\\\'s type\\\" both count as two.</p>\\r\\n<p>The famous sentence \\\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.\\\" contains 46 characters. If it takes you one minute to type this sentence, we can calculate your WPM:</p>\\r\\n<p>Characters Typed in One Minute / 5 = WPM<br>\\r\\n46 / 5 = <strong>9.2 WPM</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>But what happens if your finger slips and you make a mistake?</p>\\r\\n<h2>Accuracy of Inaccuracies</h2>\\r\\n<p>While there is no standard for factoring in incorrectly typed letters, we\\\'ve found the best solution is to separate Accuracy and Speed. In the above example, if you mistyped one letter you would have still typed <strong>9.2 WPM</strong>, but with a <strong>98%</strong> accuracy.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Gross WPM vs Net WPM</h2>\\r\\n<p>In past versions of Bicheech.com, we used a statistic called \\\"Net Words Per Minute\\\", which was your WPM * Accuracy %. We have since removed this calculation, as it motivated typists to focus too heavily on their WPM while ignoring their accuracy, leading to more mistakes and inevitably lower overall WPM.</p>\\r\\n<p><i style=\\\"font-style: italic;\\\">Slow down to go faster!</i></p>\\r\\n<p class=\\\"center\\\"><img src=\\\"https://uploads.bicheech.com/uploads/1442945869_three-stars.png\\\"></p>\\r\\n<h2>Accurately Measuring Typing Ability</h2>\\r\\n<p>While the calculations above are pretty straightforward, they do not take into account the difficulty of the content being typed, the length of the test, or the familiarity the typist may have with the material.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Difficulty of Content</h3>\\r\\n<p>It should be no surprise that typing \\\"I am a student and I enjoy typing easy words!\\\" is a whole lot easier than typing \\\"Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis\\\", despite them both being 45 characters long. Our Timed Typing Tests contain content specifically written to closely mimic average word and sentence length, structure, and punctuation.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Length of Test</h3>\\r\\n<p>Much like running, the longer you type, the slower you will go; to a point. We have found the 3 and 5 minute tests to be the most accurate gauge of overall typing speed, as they are long enough to produce a repeatable average speed and accuracy, without being too long as to fatigue the wrists and fingers.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Familiarity of Content</h3>\\r\\n<p>Type the same sentence over and over and you will get faster and faster. Your fingers love familiar content, and are quick to commit repetition to muscle memory. While great for typing <a href=\\\"https://www.bicheech.com/student/lessons/328/common-english-words\\\" target=\\\"_BLANK\\\">the most common english words</a>, this may inflate your speed if typing the same content repeatedly.

Blaisdell. Nonetheless, she remained a legend and continued to travel around the world to demonstrate her incredible skill.</p>\n<h1>Which is the fastest keyboard?</h1>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Nearly a century later, another female typist rose to fame as the fastest typist in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">The year was 1985, when Barbara Blackburn became listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for her speed of 170 wpm. She was even able to manage an average of 150 wpm over the course of 50 minutes. Now that’s endurance!</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Even more shocking to spectators than her speed was the fact that Barbara was not using your typical QWERTY keyboard. Instead she typed using the relatively unknown Dvorak keyboard.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">This keyboard was developed by a Dr. Dvorak, who spent over a decade studying the English language and hand physiotherapy to design what he believed to be a better keyboard. One on which it would supposedly be easier to learn and faster to type.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Barbara claims that she had always struggled with typing in school with the QWERTY keyboard, and it wasn’t until she discovered the Dvorak keyboard that she was able to reach such remarkable speeds.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Her top speed ever recorded is an astounding 212 wpm.</p>\n<h1>Who is the fastest typist today?</h1>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">With the onset of modern-day computers, more competitions and records have been held online through typing apps and other models.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">While these records may be harder to verify and not as official, they still hold testament to the impressive typing speeds that are accomplished today with the modern keyboard.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">On one online typing platform, Brazilian Guilherme Sandrini reached a whopping typing speed of 241.82 wpm.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Sean Wrona set another record at the Ultimate Typing Championship with a speed of 256 wpm. Wrona has also unofficially beaten Blackburn’s endurance typing record by maintaining a speed of 174 wpm over a 50-minute duration. Though this record is not recognized by Guinness because it wasn’t monitored by their team.</p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Both of these incredible speed typers used the standard QWERTY to achieve these top speeds.</p>\n<h1>How fast are YOU?</h1>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Have you ever wondered how fast you can type?

He’s been training his entire life for these races, but this little routine that he goes through before each race helps him to unleash his full potential at the time it’s being tested.\n\nFor students who are facing down the prospect of a timed test, there’s a lot to learn from Phelps’ experience.\n\nJust the same, typing speed is built up with practice over time, it doesn’t come overnight. You develop it naturally as you build up muscle memory in your fingers.\n\nThat said, before an important timed test, there are a few things you can help yourself to get an extra jolt of speed.\n\nHere are some tricks you can use to help speed up your touch typing on the spot:\n\n(Scroll down for a shareable infographic that will help you remember these tips!)\n\nFlex Your Hands – Before you begin, flex and move your hands and fingers to warm them up.\n\nWarm Up – Before you start, warm up your fingers by keying a few practice sentences. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” makes a good warm up because it contains all the letters of the alphabet.\n\nTake a Few Deep Breaths – Just before the timed test begins, take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Repeat several times. The extra air in your lungs will help calm your nerves.\n\nKeep Your Eyes Focused – During the timed test, keep your eyes on the text you are typing.

Just move on so you can keep a steady typing pace until the timed test is over.\n\nOnce again, typing speed doesn’t come overnight, it comes from practicing regularly.

Here are 10 of the top professions, and how typing is an integral part of the job.','In today’s technologically advanced world, basic computer skills like typing are becoming necessary in most professions.\n\nMany employers now seek a minimum typing speed of 50 words per minute simply for the sake of productivity, and around 30% of managers say they wouldn’t hire someone who can’t touch type.\n\nWhatever career path you choose, typing could be the skill that sets you apart!\n\n\n\nTop Keyboard-Intensive Professions\nYou might be surprised at how much time people in major professions spend hitting the keys, even when their job technically has nothing to do with computers:\n\nPhysician\nAccording to a study recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, nearly half of a doctor’s day is now spent typing information into electronic medical records or doing other administrative work. They spend more time documenting what they find than examining patients.\n\nWriter or Journalist\nMost journalists and writers spend the majority of their day (long days…) typing up stories, researching online, and using their computers to find, process, and generate information. For them, touch typing ability and speed are especially critical.\n\nComputer Programmer\nFiguring out how to solve problems is a key part of this position. The solution always involves pounding out hundreds or thousands of lines of code. Then debug those and repeat. Programmers are especially notorious for marathon keyboard sessions, spending 6-8 hours a day or longer at the keyboard.\n\nWeb Developer\nWhether manipulating graphics with design software, coding the HTML and JavaScript that run things behind the scenes, or moving everything over 3 pixels (for the third time), a web dev’s hands are always on the keyboard. If typing speed leaves something to be desired, fewer websites are completed (and paid for).\n\nPolice Officer\nFor every incident or arrest police officers type up a report. Statistics show they spend about 40% of their time on such work. That’s 4 hours out of every 10-hour shift. Some officers’ primary work is “desk duty,” rather than patrolling, where they spend even more time typing.\n\nManager/CEO\nCommunicating with others is at the core of this job. Whether interacting with employees or building up personal networks, there’s a lot of email and typing involved.\n\nLawyer\nFor attorneys, who typically bill by the hour, the phrase time = money is especially true. Meeting with clients or going to court are the meat and potatoes of legal work, but a lot more time goes to recording client meeting notes, typing up legal briefs, and following up on email correspondence. Learn to type efficiently and cut time spent on every one of these by one third to one half.\n\nScientist\nFor scientists, it’s all about the data. That data has to be recorded, organized, analyzed, and written up for publication. Where does all of that happen? At the keyboard, of course.\n\nWriting at the Speed of Thought\nThe bottom line is that touch typing allows you to type without thinking about it. You won’t be slowed down by figuring out where the next key is located. Even if you’ve developed a pretty speedy two-finger technique and don’t have to look at the keyboard much, learning the touch typing, home keys method will make you much faster.\n\nIt’s also not very hard to master. If you practice just 15 minutes a day for several weeks, your typing speed will dramatically increase. Learn to type the right way, for free, at Typing.com.

It is also known by many as the being the strangest and least logical keyboard in existence.','France is known across the world for its incredible designers—from Coco Chanel to Gustave Eiffel (who designed the Eiffel Tower). All of whom are renown for their unique and elegant designs.\n\nOne French design that’s not to love? The French keyboard.\n\nThe French have their own keyboard (also used in Belgium) that is known as the AZERTY keyboard. It is also known by many as the being the strangest and least logical keyboard in existence.\n\nWhile there are minimal differences in letter placement from the QWERTY keyboard most of us are used to (A is swapped with Q and Z is swapped with W, for example), there are plenty of other peculiarities that make little sense at all, even to the French.\n\nBelow are just a few of the oddities.\n\nFrench Keyboard Peculiarities\n1. Typing a period\nThe French keyboard is the only one in the world that requires the user to press and hold shift in order to type a period. On the same button as the semicolon, the less common semicolon is given preference over the incredibly common period. What gives?\n\n\n\n2. Typing numbers\nAlong with the period, numbers can only be accessed using the shift key! Just imagine the headache of trying to create an invoice or add data to a spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n3. Impossible to find symbols\nMany commonly used symbols such as the @ sign or French quotation marks don’t appear on the keyboard at all. They’re so tricky to find that most French people resort to copying and pasting them from another source.\n\n\n\n4. Letter “ù”  key\nWhile there’s no key for the @ sign and the period shares its key with the semicolon, the letter ù has a key all to itself. What’s so crazy about that? The letter ù is only used in ONE word in the entire French language où (where).\n\n\n\n5. Letter “a” placement\nThe letter “a” is very common in the French language, and yet it’s been relegated to the hardest to reach spots, typically accessed with the left pinky.\n\n\n\nFuture of the French Keyboard\nIt’s one thing that foreigners struggle to use the French keyboard, but French natives are equally (if not more) outraged by its complete lack of logic.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that The Culture Ministry announced that they were working on a new version of the French keyboard in 2016. No news yet on when and if this will ever become a reality.\n\nSo even if the QWERTY keyboard may not be perfect, at least we know where to find the @ sign!','2013-12-22 17:23:17','French-Keyboard-2.png','French-Keyboard-2.png',NULL,NULL,'','',''),(39,2,'Teaching students about creating and managing passwords','teaching-students-creating-managing-passwords','Here are some tips that will help you save time and a major headache whenever your students are logging in to online services.','On a recent visit to a local school that is using Typing.com in their classrooms, we discovered that the teachers were facing a major headache at the start of each class when the students had to log in.\n\nAt least 20 minutes of the class time was eaten up by students who couldn’t remember their passwords and couldn’t log in.\n\nNow, I’m sure that these teachers aren’t the only ones facing this challenge, so here are some tips we’ve come up with to help young students understand, create, and manage their passwords.\n\nExplaining the importance of passwords to students\nBefore setting kids off on a new computer program where they’ll need to choose a password, make sure to have a conversation about what the purpose of an internet password is and why it is important to make them unique and keep them a secret.\n\nEven if the threat of someone accessing their Typing.com account doesn’t seem all that imminent or dangerous, we want students to take password creation seriously as early on as possible.\n\nThus, down the road when they are creating passwords for an online bank account or health insurance provider, they understand the importance of the task.\n\nHelping your students create their passwords\nWith kids (ok, and most adults as well) it is important that passwords strike a balance between being memorable, but not so easy that they could easily be guessed.\n\nWith younger students, a good place to start is to have students generate passwords that use a combination of a personal word, phrase, or abbreviation with a number that they will remember.\n\nTo keep this simple you could ask them all to make a password with their favorite color and number. Eg. blue7\n\nOptional: Use a password generator\nThere are also websites such as dinopass.com that will automatically generate strong passwords for kids. But, since these are not personalized, it is less likely that a student will remember it.\n\nHow to help students remember their passwords\nWhen starting out, we recommend that students write down their password somewhere safe when they first create it so that they can reference it the first few times they log-on.\n\nSoon enough, they will have committed it to memory and as long as they are using the website on a regular basis, they shouldn’t have any password problems.\n\nWhat to do if your students forget their passwords\nOn Typing.com, even though teachers have the option to login and check or reset a student’s password, we recommend against doing this.\n\nInstead of just giving them their passwords each time, we suggest having a “memory question” that you can ask students that will help them remember their password. This will help them to improve their memories and to teach them responsibility.\n\nIf you have them all create passwords with the same combinations (ie. favorite color and number), your job will be even easier.\n\nTeaching your students early on the basics of creating and managing passwords, you will be doing them an invaluable service, which will help secure their online presence in the future.\n\nWe hope these tips will save you a significant amount of time and headache with each lesson!\n\nIf you have any additional suggestions, we’d love to hear them!

The same is true for working with an organized computer desktop. In honor of “National Clean Your Virtual Desktop Day” here are our top tips for keeping your virtual desktop clean and organized.','Studies show that people are more productive when working in an organized workspace. We’re willing to bet the same is true for working with an organized computer desktop.\n\nFor one, computers actually run more slowly when the desktop is cluttered with dozens of documents, photos, excel sheets, and applications. Additionally, a messy desktop makes it harder to find what you’re looking for and is more distracting when you sit down to get work done.\n\nNonetheless, the job of keeping a virtual desktop clutter free feels like an unrelenting battle. Even after a thorough desktop purge, a few days later it’s a mess again.\n\nIn honor of “National Clean Your Virtual Desktop Day” here are our top tips for keeping your virtual desktop clean and organized.\n\nUse folders (in folders)\nWhen it comes to desktop organization, folders are your friend. Yes, it will take you a few extra clicks to get to what you’re looking for, but if your folders are set up in a logical way, you’ll know where everything is. Once you’ve set up folders for the broadest categories of documents you save (work, home, school, etc.) create folders within these folders to further categorize the types of files you want to archive.\n\nTry out sectioned wallpaper\nThere are plenty of sectioned wallpapers you can download that allow you to sort files and folders into categories right on your desktop. This is a great option if you are a visual person who likes to see where everything is, but still want to bring some order to your home screen.\n\nCustomize your desktop\nFor some people, all it takes to keep their desktop clean and tidy is a sentimental photo that they don’t want to obstruct. Try uploading a meaningful photo as your wallpaper instead of one of the generic flowerscapes that came with your computer. If it’s a photo you love, you might find that you’re more likely to periodically clean up your desktop just so the photo looks its best.\n\nSchedule a periodic cleaning\nSure, it’s easy enough to say you are going to tidy up your desktop every Friday before you leave the office, but, like many things, this is easier said than done. Since organizing one’s desktop is never 100% necessary, it’s a task that often gets skipped over in favor of more urgent work. Make cleaning up your desktop a priority by scheduling an appointment in your calendar periodically. It will be much harder to avoid when you get a pesky reminder on your screen that it’s time for a desktop tidy.\n\nTry out Google Drive\nIf it’s Microsoft Office documents that are making most of the mess on your desktop, consider switching over to Google Drive. Aside from dozens of other perks to the Google Drive platform, all of your documents get automatically saved online, meaning that you’ll never have to save anything to your desktop. A warning here, though. If you’re not careful, it’s very easy to end up with a Google Drive that is just as cluttered as your desktop.\n\nSo in honor of “National Clean Your Virtual Desktop Day” set aside some time this week to clean up your desktop once and for all by trying out some of these tips.

When it comes to how to protect their vision, our recommendation is the 20-20-10 rule.','For all the complaining they are capable of, kids are often tougher than we give them credit for.\n\nKids can scrape a knee, brush it off, and get right back to playing, all for the sake of not missing the remainder of the kickball game.\n\nThere are instances, though, where this toughness can get kids into trouble. They may not realize that something that’s slightly uncomfortable (carrying a 40-pound backpack, say) is actually bad for their health.\n\nWhen using computers for extended periods of time, students are likely to ignore discomfort, especially if they are engaged in what they are working on.\n\nOne place where we see this most often is with the effect that computer use has on one’s eyes. Many adults are also guilty of using computers to an extent that can negatively affect their eyesight, but students are even more susceptible to this.\n\nRead on to find out why and how you can help your students protect their eyes during computer use.\n\nWhy Students Are Especially at Risk\nWhile excessive computer use can wreak havoc on anyone’s eyesight, it is especially threatening for children for a number of reasons:\n\nKids tend to zone in more on the computer screen than adults. They often get so involved in what they’re looking at that they forget to blink.\nIf students are using computers that were set up for adult use (either at home or at school) or were set up improperly, it can cause additional eye strain if students are looking up at their computer screen.\nIn many ways, kids are more resilient than adults. One such way? They tend to ignore discomfort and may not take the necessary steps to change the situation.\nMany students accept blurry vision when staring at a screen, thinking that is what happens to everyone when using a computer.\nOur Recommendation: The 20-20-10 Rule\nAs teachers, it is our responsibility to make sure that students learn appropriate guidelines for computer use. When it comes to how to protect their vision, our recommendation is the 20-20-10 rule.\n\nThis easy to remember rule can be implemented in your classroom as a standard part of computer use. Eye doctors recommend that every 20 minutes your students should take their eyes off of the computer screen and look at an object at least 20 feet away for at least 10 seconds. These periodic breaks from staring at the screen can reduce the risk of focusing fatigue that can cause nearsightedness in children.\n\n20-20-10 rule: Every 20 mins have your students look at something 20 ft away for 10 seconds.TWEET IT\nStudents won’t likely abide by the 20-20-10 rule if left to their own devices, so it’s important that as a teacher you invest students in the rule and create structures to help them follow it. Consider the following ideas:\n\n1. Explain the dangers to students\nBrief students on why it is important to rest your eyes every once in awhile during computer time with an analogy. Like riding a horse through a desert, bad riders may ignore the horse’s needs and keep riding until their horse can’t take it anymore and collapses. Good riders pay attention to the needs of their horse and let it rest regularly. This way the horse will be able to go further in the long-term.\n\n2. Put up something to look at during rest periods\nPut a fun poster on the far end of the room or perhaps even on the ceiling so students have something specific to focus on for their 10-second break.\n\n3. Set a timer\nWhen computer time starts, set an alarm for 20 minutes and repeat as needed. Set the expectation that when the time goes off everyone’s eyes must be directed towards the poster or another designated point.\n\n4. Make a game of it!\nAsk students to find something in the poster and shout out their answer. This will get everyone involved, and if the solution is sufficiently difficult this should take up the full 10 seconds.\n\nIn addition to helping students protect their eyes while at the computer, you also want to encourage safe typing posture so that students acquire safe typing habits across the board. Check out our previous post here for ideas on how to help students protect their neck and back while sitting at the computer.\n\nIf you can get students accustomed to these habits early on, they’ll be much more likely to practice safe computer use later in life.','2013-12-22 17:23:17','Protect-Students-Eyes.png','Protect-Students-Eyes.png',NULL,NULL,'','','');
